# Asset-Lifecycle-Dashboard-API
The Asset Lifecycle Dashboard API is a "ServiceNow Scripted REST API" that provides a 360° view of IT assets — from procurement to retirement. It consolidates data across multiple ServiceNow tables (alm_asset, incident, sc_request, etc.) and returns it in a clean JSON format. This project demonstrates securing the API using OAuth 2.0 in ServiceNow.
